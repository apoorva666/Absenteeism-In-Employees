# Absenteeism-In-Employees
A Machine Learning model to predict if an employee is going to be excessively absent.

The dataset contains the absenteeism records & the stated reasons of 700 employees over a period of 1 year. Our Machine Learning model has analyzed the relationship between all the features to predict if an employee is going to be absent for more than 3 days in a month or not, which is considered as a benchmark for excessive absenteeism.

Features in the dataset are:    <br />
 1   ID                         <br />
 2   Reason for Absence          <br />
 3   Date                       <br />
 4   Transportation Expense      
 5   Distance to Work          
 6   Age                       
 7   Daily Work Load Average   
 8   Body Mass Index           
 9   Education                 
 10  Children                  
 11  Pets                      
 12  Absenteeism Time in Days  <br />
 
 Algorithms used:     <br />
 1 Logistic Regression  <br />
 2 Naive Bayes
 3 Support Vector Machines
 4 Decision Tree
 5 Decision Tree with Pre Pruning
 6 Decision Tree with post pruning
 7 Random Forest
 8 K - Nearest Neighbors
 9 Ada Boost	
 10	XG Boost
 
 Procedure:
 1 Loading the dataset
 
 2 Preprocessing the data - Checking for missing values, outliers, checking if the dataset is balanced, removing unnecessary features, checking the presence of 
   multicollinearity, converting the data into a more understandable format, & standardization of the data.
   
 3 Splitting the dataset for training & testing
